Simplified Vancouver Algorithm

Author: Donald "Drew" Bronson
Creation Date:  12 May 2016

This algorithm was developed by Jason Hartline, Samuel Taggart, and Doug Downey at Northwestern University as part of
a research project in the field of peer grading algorithms. It represents a simplified version of the Vancouver
algorithm and is hypothesized by the above to output comparable results.

This file is a complete re-write of the original.
