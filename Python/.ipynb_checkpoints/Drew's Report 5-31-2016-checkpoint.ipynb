This means, unfortunately, that the error scales down linearly with time and effort, and there is no real \"tipping point\" of how much effort should be put in. This is actually a somewhat surprising result, since it means that Vancouver is not really able to use the information from ground truth very effectively.

    "I have conducted simulations in several areas. First, I wanted to verify Vancouver, and this was easy. For a sample size of twenty students grading three submissions each, ten iterations appears to be sufficient to allow the algorithm to appropriately converge. Second, I wanted to determine the manner in which injection of ground truth grades would cause the error to change. I have found that said injection causes the mean error to decrease linearly, which implies that non-ground-truth assignments are not affected by ground truth injection in a meaningful way. Third, I attempted to determine if the use of a planted cover would be different than not using a planted cover in this regard, to see if we might gain bonus benefits by having graded a cover. I was able to discern no such difference; the plots appear to be identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of grading assignments, this means that the work required to be done by the TAs is linear with the error considered allowable by the instructors. The maximum error is even worse, decreasing slowly until it drops off sharply near the end, though this can be rendered largely irrelevant by the presence of an appeals process."
