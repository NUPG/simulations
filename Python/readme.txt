The important files are below:

1. peer_review_assignment.py

This contains all the updated peer assignment functions.

2. Vancouver.ipynb

Vancouver algorithm - contains simple and regular vancouver algorithms. It needs peer_review_assignment.py.

3. Vancouver from Master.py

This is the vancouver algorithm submitted with the original paper. We don't really use this.

4. peer_review.py

This is outdated - use Vancouver instead. (It has outdated code for Vancouver and peer_review_assignment).

5. vancouver_simulations.py

This contains simulation code for ground truth injection. This needs to be modified to work with peer_review_assignment, as currently it uses the outdated peer_review.py.
